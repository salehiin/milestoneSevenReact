# Loving the process is key
# Whereever you focus your energy flows
# Do everyday, every week, every month
# Discipline gives you the freedom to do what you really want 
# Sacrifice leads to gains
# If you wanna change your life you need to be busy
# Pack your schedule
# the more active you are the more you achive
